# C++ & DSA Journey

This repository contains my C++ practice programs and my ongoing preparation for Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA).

## Contents
- C++ basics and logic-building programs
- Formula-based problems
- DSA practice (to be added)

This repository will be updated regularly as I progress.

## 📌 Learning Progress

✔ Completed C++ fundamentals including:
- Conditionals
- Loops
- Arrays
- Pointers
- Strings

🔄 Currently revising:

- Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)

📅 Maintaining consistent learning and GitHub contributions.

## Current Progress
- Completed C++ basics, arrays, strings, pointers and OOPs
- Currently exploring STL (Vector, Stack, Queue, Map, List)
