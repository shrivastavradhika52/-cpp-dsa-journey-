# C++ & DSA Journey

This repository contains my C++ practice programs and my ongoing preparation for Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA).

## Contents
- C++ basics and logic-building programs
- Formula-based problems
- DSA practice (to be added)

This repository will be updated regularly as I progress.

## 📌 Learning Progress

✔ Completed C++ fundamentals including:
- Conditionals
- Loops
- Arrays
- Pointers
- Strings

🔄 Currently revising:
- Functions

🎯 Next focus:

- Applying concepts through mini projects
- Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)

📅 Maintaining consistent learning and GitHub contributions.

## Current Progress
- Completed C++ basics, arrays, strings, pointers and OOPs.
  
- completed stl basics 
- DSA practice starting soon.

  🧠 Current Focus: Recursion

I’m currently starting with Recursion, which is helping me understand:

1. How problems can be broken into smaller subproblems

2. Base cases and recursive calls

3. Thinking in terms of function stack flow
