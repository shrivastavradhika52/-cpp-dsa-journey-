# C++ & DSA Journey

This repository contains my C++ practice programs and my ongoing preparation for Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA).

## Contents
- C++ basics and logic-building programs
- Formula-based problems
- DSA practice (to be added)

This repository will be updated regularly as I progress.

## 📌 Learning Progress

✔ Completed C++ fundamentals including:
- Conditionals
- Loops
- Arrays
- Pointers
- Strings

🔄 Currently revising:
- Functions

🎯 Next focus:

- Applying concepts through mini projects
- Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)

📅 Maintaining consistent learning and GitHub contributions.

## Current Progress
- Completed C++ basics, arrays, strings, pointers and OOPs and stl basics
- DSA practice started !

  🧠 Current Focus: Recursion 

I’m currently working on Recursion, which is helping me understand:

1. How problems can be broken into smaller subproblems.

2. Base cases and recursive calls.

📌 Progress Update: Recursion Completed ✅

I have successfully completed the Recursion fundamentals as part of my DSA journey.
This phase helped me understand how to break complex problems into smaller subproblems and strengthened my problem-solving approach.

🚀 Next Phase: Arrays (Starting Now)

After building a strong base in recursion, I am now moving to Arrays in Data Structures & Algorithms.

🎯 Upcoming Focus

1.Array traversal

2.Linear Search

3.Maximum & Minimum in Array

4.Basic array problems for logic building

   Problem-solving with time complexity awareness

    This marks the transition from recursion thinking ➝ data structure-based problem solving.
